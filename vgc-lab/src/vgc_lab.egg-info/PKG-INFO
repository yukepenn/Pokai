# vgc-lab

Python wrapper and utilities for Pokemon Showdown CLI, focused on Gen 9 VGC Reg F battle simulation and data collection.

## Overview

`vgc-lab` is a helper project that wraps the sibling `pokemon-showdown/` folder (a fork of smogon/pokemon-showdown). It provides Python utilities to:

- Generate random teams for VGC formats
- Validate teams against format rules
- Run CLI simulated battles (AI vs AI) without requiring the web server
- Save battle logs and structured metadata under `vgc-lab/data/`

## Project Structure

- `src/vgc_lab/` - Main Python package
  - `config.py` - Paths and configuration
  - `showdown_cli.py` - Wrappers around `node pokemon-showdown` CLI commands
  - `battle_logger.py` - BattleResult model and persistence utilities
- `scripts/` - CLI tools and demo scripts
- `data/` - Generated data (teams, battle logs, JSON results)

## Team Preview Dataset

`vgc-lab` can generate structured team preview datasets from simulated battles:

- **TeamPreviewSnapshot**: Represents the open team sheet state at the start of a Reg F battle, including both players' full teams (6 Pokémon each) with moves, items, abilities, and Tera types
- **Generation method**: Uses `generate_random_team` + `simulate_battle` to create battle logs, then parses team preview requests from the logs
- **Dataset location**: `data/datasets/team_preview/team_preview.jsonl` (JSON Lines format, one snapshot per line)
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  cd Pokai/vgc-lab
  python scripts/generate_team_preview_dataset.py generate --n 50
  ```

This dataset is intended as the input space for future agents making team-preview decisions (which 4 mons to bring, BO3 planning, etc.), but RL/ML implementation is out of scope for this phase.

## Full Battle Dataset (Random Self-Play)

`vgc-lab` can generate datasets of completed battles using Showdown's internal random AI:

- **Method**: Uses Showdown's `BattleStream` and `RandomPlayerAI` via a Node.js script (`js/random_selfplay.js`)
- **Generation**: The script `scripts/generate_full_battle_dataset.py` runs complete battles and collects results
- **Output**: JSONL dataset with battle logs, winners, turn counts, and metadata
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  cd Pokai/vgc-lab
  python scripts/generate_full_battle_dataset.py --n 5
  ```
- **Data locations**:
  - Raw logs: `data/battles_raw/`
  - Dataset: `data/datasets/full_battles/full_battles.jsonl`

The Node script `js/random_selfplay.js` serves as the bridge to Showdown's battle engine, running battles to completion and outputting structured JSON results.

## Preview + Outcome Dataset (Random Self-Play)

`vgc-lab` can generate datasets that directly tie open team sheets to battle outcomes:

- **Method**: Uses Showdown's internal `RandomPlayerAI` and the same engine as `js/random_selfplay.js`
- **Data stored**: For each battle:
  - Both sides' 6-Pokémon public teams (from the engine, via `Teams.unpack`)
  - The winner (`winner_side` / `winner_name`)
  - The path to the raw battle log
- **Generation**: The script `scripts/generate_preview_outcome_dataset.py` runs complete battles and stores preview+outcome pairs
- **Dataset location**: `data/datasets/preview_outcome/preview_outcome.jsonl`
- **Usage example**:
  ```bash
  cd Pokai/vgc-lab
  python scripts/generate_preview_outcome_dataset.py --n 5
  ```
- **Data locations**:
  - Raw logs: `data/battles_raw/` (shared with other scripts)
  - Dataset: `data/datasets/preview_outcome/preview_outcome.jsonl`

You can then load `preview_outcome.jsonl` from Python / Jupyter for analysis or model training.

## Future Extensions

This project will later be extended for RL/DL training environments, but currently focuses on:
1. Establishing clean battle simulation workflows
2. Collecting battle logs and structured data
3. Providing reusable Python APIs for team generation and validation
4. Building datasets for team preview decision-making

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 16+ and npm (for the underlying `pokemon-showdown` CLI)
- The `pokemon-showdown/` folder must be present as a sibling directory

## Quick Start

See the local server quickstart guide for setup instructions.
